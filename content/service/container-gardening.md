Containers also expand useful landscape space while adding versatility to gardens large and small. With proper positioning they may:

·    highlight the unique colour, texture and form of a plant.

·    be a focal point in the garden.

·    present a gesture of softness or a bold statement.

·    provide an easy to achieve seasonal change.

·   marry the architecture and style of the house to the surrounding landscape.

·    lend instant colour in shaded areas.

  provide opportunities for variety and diversity of plants including edibles

Container gardens offer many benefits whether they are a stand alone, integrated into a garden, or amassed. They are:

·    make gardening accessible for those with limited mobility and the elderly.

·    low maintenance.

·    have fewer problems with weeds or pests than a garden bed.

·    provide opportunities for variety and diversity of plants including edibles.
