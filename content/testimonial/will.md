The Artistry Experience by Will Elmore

While in prison I would often try to imagine what my life might look like if I were not locked up. What kind of work would I be doing? How much money would I make? Who would give a felon like me an opportunity?

At other times I wouldn’t think or worry about that at all. After all, I was told “to spend the rest of my natural life” in prison. However, miracles DO happen! I was given a second chance at freedom on December 21, 2015 after serving more than 25 years time. And soon after my release, I was also given an opportunity of employment that not only financially pays me well, but also abundantly feeds me emotionally and spiritually.

I thank Artistry In Plants (henceforth, Artistry) ) for having the faith and courage to give guys (and gals) like me the opportunity to give back and make amends to people of society, communities, family and those affected by our crime(s); and also the opportunity to practice humility, forgive ourselves, and continue to grow and develop. Artistry is a landscape design not-for-profit that offers employment to those seeking second, or even third chances. This includes men and women on welfare, homeless, veterans, addicts, those adjudicated in the courts, or seeking reentry from incarceration.

As a true born and bred New Jersey boy, my knowledge of (outdoor) Nature was predicated by the experiences I had in city parks. It was a long time before I even understood that these parks were man-made. To work with nature and to use my hands, body, intellect, and imagination to help sustainably beautify peoples’ homes and communities is a gift to give and receive; and to work in cooperation with homeowners and neighbors is to respect and to be respected - everything about participating as a crew member of Artistry has been therapeutic for me as I transition and adjust from living purposely separated from others, to become a contributing member of society.

Soon after working with Artistry, I began to understand and appreciate nature differently. The personality of our crew and how we integrate “who we are” with the actual work we do, is as complex and diverse as the species of trees, shrubs, and perennials we design with. This job provides a wonderland of experience from one place to the next. I intentionally hesitate to call what I do ‘work’ - to just call it work does what we do, little justice. Here at Artistry I am in a position to be ‘free’ to learn, grow and bloom as an individual, a coworker, a person accountable to others. Artistry allows me, much like living plants, to be connected to, planted, and rooted to others, regardless of our differences or backgrounds. Because of Artistry I am much more circumspect about how we are all interconnected; how we sprout from the same source as one another, and grow cooperatively.

Here at Artistry we are about much more than employment, mulch and compost. We are continuously nurturing and watering one another, and everything and everyone we come in contact with. We work with integrity, diligence and professionalism, we inspire one another to become the best people we can be. This is not what we refer to as “work,” - we call this ‘The Artistry Experience.’
